                    <p class="introduction-description">In the year 2197, Earth has become uninhabitable due to climate catastrophes and resource depletion. The surviving humanity has gathered in the giant space city of AstraNova, which orbits the Earth and has become the last home for humanity.</p>
                    <p>The city is divided into four zones:<br>

                    🏠 Core Level – where most citizens call home, a safe and bustling residential hub.<br>

                    ⚙️ Engineers’ Zone – vast mechanical halls and power stations that hum with life, keeping AstraNova running.<br>

                    🛒 Market Plateau – the city’s beating heart of trade and black-market dealings, alive day and night.

                    🌑 Shadow Zone – a forbidden, mysterious area where unstable systems and strange creatures lurk in the shadows.</p>
                    <p>A portal for newcomers introduces the city’s rules, history, and characters. Everyone must choose their own path: to maintain the system among the Engineers, to seek influence through the traders, or to risk entering the Shadow Zone for the sake of knowledge.</p>
                    <p>The main conflict revolves around survival and power. The city needs everyone's help to survive, but the Engineer Council and the shadowy lords of the market secretly fight for control. Meanwhile, rumors spread that a portal to a new planet lies in the Shadow Zone - a possible escape route, but perhaps just a legend.</p>
